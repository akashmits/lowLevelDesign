1:SOLID principal(Object Oriented Desing Concept)
Solid refers to five design principels in object oriented programming, designed to reduce code rot and improve the value,
function, and maintainability of software.
The SOLID principles help the user develop less coupled code.
If code is tightly coupled, a group of classes are dependent on one another.
This should be avoided for better maintainability and readability.
    1.1: Single Responsibility Principal: Each class should have only one responsibility, only one reason to change
        Mixing Responsibilites also makes the class harder to understand and harder to test, decresing cohesion.

    1:2: Open Closed Principal: classes should be open for extension but close for modification
        Applying OCP to your projects limits the need to change source code once it hasbeen written, tested and debugged.
        This reduces the riskof introducing new bugs to existing code, leading to more robust software
    1.3: Liskov substitution: any interface should be replacable by any of its implementation without breaking the logic
    1.4: Interface segregation : Instead of having one general purpose interfaces ,its better to have  specific interface
    1.5: Dependancy inversion: Depend on abstraction, not on concration
