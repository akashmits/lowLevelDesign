Add Project on Git first Time:
git remote add origin https://github.com/akashmits/lowLevelDesign.git

git add .
git commit -m "Initial Commit"

If you push code first time then you will get error:
To https://github.com/akashmits/lowLevelDesign.git
 ! [rejected]        main -> main (non-fast-forward)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/akashmits/lowLevelDesign.git'
hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind
hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.
hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

To solve this error, need to rebase branch which branch u want to push code:

 git pull --rebase origin main

then use command push code:
git push origin main
